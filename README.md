### HI, I'm Jeremy Morgan. Geek, Teacher, and Lifelong LearnerðŸ‘‹

I love coding and sharing what I learn, as I learn it. I'm split pretty well between Linux/Go/Python and Windows/C#/Blazor stuff at the moment. 

I'm a huge fan of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and I'm finding new ways to modify and bend it every day for [Programming Blog](https://www.jeremymorgan.com)

You can catch [my live streams here](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremymorgan) or check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/jeremymorgan)


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building content to teach coding
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computer Vision, and advanced Go

I'm working on a few small projects, nothing big. I generally use this to store code from my tutorials, courses, YouTube videos etc.
