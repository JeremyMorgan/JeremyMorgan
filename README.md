### Welcome to my ProfileðŸ‘‹

I love coding and sharing what I learn, as I learn it. I'm split pretty well between Linux/Go/Python and Windows/C#/Blazor stuff at the moment. 

You can catch [my live streams here](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremymorgan) or check out my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/jeremymorgan)

I'm currently working on a few small projects, nothing big. I generally use this to store code from my tutorials, courses, YouTube videos etc.
